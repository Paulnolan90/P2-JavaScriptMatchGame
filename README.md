## Testing

Throughout the development and testing stages, I utilized the Chrome Developer Tool to mimic various viewport sizes, including desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile views, to ensure the website's responsiveness and compatibility.

The deployed website underwent testing on Chrome, Edge, Firefox desktop browsers, as well as on mobile devices using the Chrome for Android browser.

- ### User stories' testing:
    - I would like to play a simple game to test my memory by matching up pairs of images
        - Memory match game uses Pokemon images to test the users memory - hidden images are arranged at random and change position each time the game is loaded
    - I expect feedback to confirm each matching pair made and the matched images remain on show
        - sound effects play at game load stage, with each card turn-over, with each non-successful and successful matching, and successful game completion. Matched image pairs remain on show
    - I expect to see my score
        - score is displayed below the game grid
    - I expect confirmation that I have completed the game successfully
        - on successful game completion, a sound is played and a pop-up modal appears with a congratulaions message
    - I would like the option to restart/replay the game 
        - a button appears below the game grid giving the player the option to restart. This presents a pop-up with a yes/no confirmation option. There is also a replay button within the game completion pop-up modal
    - I expect to be able to play on different devices (laptop, mobile and tablet)
        - the game was tested, and works, on desktop/laptop, tablet and mobile
    - I expect to have fun! :)
        - I had fun! :)

- ### Bugs
    - After finishing the excercise I had realised that I didnt deploy the code institute template, the site still fully works so I cannot see if this will have any effect.
    - /*jshint esversion: 6 */ added this to the script.js file to get rid of errors when tested on JSHint
